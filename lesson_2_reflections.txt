How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
The working directory is all of the files in their current state, 
while the staging area is temporary space for grouping files to be 
committed to the repository.  This is useful since it allows you to 
commit files together, as code projects can typically involve 
multiple files to (re)solve the given task.
