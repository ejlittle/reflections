How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
The working directory is all of the files in their current state, 
while the staging area is temporary space for grouping files to be 
committed to the repository.  This is useful since it allows you to 
commit files together, as code projects can typically involve 
multiple files to (re)solve the given task.



How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per 
logical change?
You choose which files go into the staging area, and using git diff to 
compare the working directory to the staged directory, as well as git 
diff --staged to compare the staged directory to the repository, you 
can see which changes were made and adjust your staged directory 
accordingly before you commit.
