When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping 
all your work local?
You might want to use a remote repository when you are working on a 
project with a team.  This way there is a communal workspace where 
everyone's commits can be logged.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Just like a branch, you don't necessarily care about the changes 
everyone else is making until you are finished with your feature 
exploration.
