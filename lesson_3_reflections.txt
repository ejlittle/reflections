When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping 
all your work local?
You might want to use a remote repository when you are working on a 
project with a team.  This way there is a communal workspace where 
everyone's commits can be logged.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Just like a branch, you don't necessarily care about the changes 
everyone else is making until you are finished with your feature 
exploration.



Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When 
would you use one instead of another?
Forks and clones are essentially the same thing.  They are new repos 
that are duplicates of an existing repo from a particular point in 
time.  The difference is forks exist only on GitHub and clones are 
personal copies of a given repo.  Branches are different, in that 
they are diverging development paths from a particular point in time 
that are typically going to be merged back into the main development 
once the branch has been fully explored.



What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the 
remote stored locally?
Knowing this allows you to keep track of all of the changes that have 
happened since the last time you checked on the remote's status. If 
multiple people are collaborating on a single project, maybe even 
pushing changes to the master, you would want to know about it when 
you were ready to merge your changes into the remote so you don't 
overwrite someone else's work.




How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be 
easier, and what would be harder?
Email so we could have a trail of conversation.  It would be easier, 
because nobody would have to learn anything new to do it, but it 
would be difficult to know specific lines of code that changed (when 
and why) and to roll back changes.
